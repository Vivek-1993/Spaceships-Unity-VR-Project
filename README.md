# Spaceships-Unity-VR-Project
Virtual reality game in which the user can interact with the environment without the need for any physical controllers. Built using a sensor mounted on the front of the headset to track the hands. The game was built in Unity engine (scripted in C#), using the Oculus Rift CV1 headset and the Leap Motion sensor. The game involves the player positioned in the cockpit of the spaceship, which they drive by interacting with the controls using their own hands.
