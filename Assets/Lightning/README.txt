Lightning

Lightning can be used in 2D and 3D games.

The asset is easy to use:
1. You can add a prefab "ObjLightning" to set the settings to the scene.
2. Then click "Play" and look at the lightning.


Example

1. Be sure that you have the "Lightning/Example" folder imported.
2. Add scenes from the "Lightning/Example" folder to the "Build Settings" ("File->Build Settings...").
3. Open the "ExampleLightning" scene in the Editor and run it.
4. Open the "Lightning/Example/Example.cs" script to see the code.


Usage

Let's imagine that you are starting a new empty project. In this case, you could do the following:
1. Import "Lightning" folder (and all of its contents, except at the request of a folder "Lightning/Example") to your project.
2. Create a scene named "FirstScene". This scene will be the first scene in your project.
3. Add to the scene from the folder "Lightning/Prefabs" prefab "ObjLightning".
7. Run the scene named "FirstScene" and see how it works.
